Let's make sure that this text file you created contains the text you placed inside. You can display the contents of any file from the command line quickly with the `cat` command:


~~~command
$ cat greetings.txt
~~~

This command reads the contents of a given file and displays them on the screen.

You can use `cat` to read any file. However, some files are longer.
