You've already learned that typing `cd` will return you to your home directory. This is just one of the many shortcuts available on the command line.

Here are a handful of keyboard shortcuts you'll find useful:

* `Ctrl+a` jumps to the first character of the line.
* `Ctrl+e` jumps to the end of the line.
* `Ctrl+l` clears the screen's contents.
* `Ctrl+r` lets you search through your command history and execute a command.

Practice with these shortcuts; they'll make it much easier as you work through this book, as well as your own projects.
