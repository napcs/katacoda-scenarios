To return to your home directory, there are a couple of options.

The tilde, (~) represents your home directory. This command:

`cd ~`

takes you to your home directory regardless of where you are on the file system.

However, you can save a couple of keystrokes, because simply entering


`cd`{{ execute }}

will always return you to your home directory, no matter where you are.

Try these commands out:

`cd /var`{{ execute}}

`pwd`{{ execute}}

`cd`{{ execute}}

`pwd`{{ execute}}

`cd /usr/`{{ execute}}

`pwd`{{ execute}}

`cd`{{ execute}}


Ensure you're in your home directory before moving on!
