Using the CLI, navigate to your Desktop directory using the `cd` command.  The `cd` command is short for "change directory". It's somewhat like clicking on a folder to open it up in the GUI environment, except it's a little more powerful because you can use it to jump to any directory on your file system immediately, without going through any intermediate directory. We'll look at that in the next chapter.

Type this command to navigate to the `Desktop` directory:


`cd Desktop`{{ execute }}


You're now in the `Desktop` directory, which you can verify with the `pwd` command just to make sure:

`pwd`{{ execute }}
