Directories help you organize your files and projects. The `mkdir` command lets you create a directory. Let's use it create a directory called `website` on the Desktop. At the prompt, assuming youâ€™re still in your `Desktop` directory, type


`mkdir website`{{ execute }}

Use the `ls` command to view the new directory:

`ls`{{ execute }}


Once you've created the directory, you can use the `cd` command to navigate into that directory.


`cd website`{{ execute }}

You can then create new directories inside of this directory for images, stylesheets, and scripts. In the [book](https://smallsharptools.com), you'll explore more efficient ways to create complex directory structures for projects.
