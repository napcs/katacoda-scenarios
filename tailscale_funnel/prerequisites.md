# Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

* A [Tailscale](https://tailscale.io/download) account. You'll install Tailscale in this lesson but you need an account first.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run the server.
* Basic familiarity with command line operations.

Since you're running this interactive lab, you'll find that Node.js is already installed for you.

Verify that with the following command:

```
node -v
```{{ execute }}

Next you'll build a small server with Node.js.
