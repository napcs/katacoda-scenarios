Now that you know where you are, take a look around at the contents of your home directory by using the `ls` command, which lists the contents of the directory:


`ls`{{ execute }}



The output looks something like this:


```
Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public Templates Videos
```


You might see different files and directories in your home directory, as each operating system sets things up a little differently.

If your system has a GUI, you'll see a directory called `Desktop`, and anything you place in that directory will show up on your computer's graphical desktop. After all, any shortcuts, directories, or files on your Desktop have to be stored *somewhere* on your computer, right?
